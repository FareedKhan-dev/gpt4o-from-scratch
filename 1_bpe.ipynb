    "## End-to-End Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction: The Need for Subword Tokenization and BPE\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Tokenization?**\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), tokenization is the fundamental first step of breaking down raw text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are the basic building blocks that machine learning models process (e.g., words, punctuation marks).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Simple Word Tokenization:**\n",
    "Simply splitting text by spaces or punctuation seems intuitive but faces major challenges:\n",
    "1.  **Vocabulary Explosion:** If every unique word is a token, the vocabulary size can become enormous, especially with large corpora containing many word variations (e.g., 'run', 'runs', 'running', 'ran', 'runner'). This requires significant memory and computational resources.\n",
    "2.  **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Problem:** Models trained on a fixed vocabulary cannot handle words they haven't seen during training (e.g., new proper nouns, technical terms, misspellings, newly coined words). These OOV words are typically mapped to a generic `<UNK>` (unknown) token, losing valuable information.\n",
    "3.  **Morphological Relationships:** Word-level tokenization ignores the relationships between words sharing common roots or affixes (e.g., 'running', 'runner').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subword Tokenization as a Solution:**\n",
    "Subword tokenization algorithms aim to find a middle ground between character-level (tiny vocabulary, very long sequences) and word-level tokenization. They break words into smaller, meaningful units (subwords or morphemes). \n",
    "*   Common words might remain single tokens (e.g., 'the').\n",
    "*   Less common words are broken down (e.g., 'tokenization' -> 'token', 'ization').\n",
    "*   Rare or unknown words are broken down further, potentially to individual characters (e.g., 'BPEology' -> 'B', 'P', 'E', 'ology' or even smaller pieces depending on training).\n",
    "This approach keeps the vocabulary size manageable while drastically reducing the OOV problem and preserving some morphological information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): The Algorithm**\n",
    "BPE, originally a data compression technique, was adapted for NLP tokenization. Its core idea is simple and elegant: **iteratively merge the most frequent pair of adjacent symbols (characters or previously merged subwords) in the training corpus.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-Level BPE Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** Start with a vocabulary containing only individual characters found in the training text. Prepare the text by splitting it into words and representing each word as a sequence of its characters plus a special end-of-word marker (essential for learning word boundaries).\n",
    "2.  **Training (Iterative Merging):** Repeat the following for a predefined number of steps (merges):\n",
    "    a.  Count the frequency of all adjacent pairs of symbols across the entire corpus (considering word frequencies).\n",
    "    b.  Find the symbol pair that occurs most frequently.\n",
    "    c.  Merge this pair into a single new symbol (subword).\n",
    "    d.  Add this new symbol to the vocabulary.\n",
    "    e.  Replace all occurrences of the original pair in the corpus representation with the new symbol.\n",
    "3.  **Tokenization (Applying Learned Rules):** To tokenize new text:\n",
    "    a.  Preprocess it in the same way as the training data (split words, add end-of-word markers).\n",
    "    b.  Apply the learned merge operations *in the exact order they were learned* (highest priority first). Greedily merge pairs within each word until no more learned merges can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Notebook's Approach:**\n",
    "We will implement this entire process step-by-step, inline, without using Python functions or classes. Each conceptual step will be broken down into the smallest possible code block, accompanied by detailed theory, as requested."

    "### Step 5: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided an extremely detailed, step-by-step, inline implementation of the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm for text tokenization, deliberately avoiding the use of functions or classes to expose the fundamental logic at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We meticulously followed the key phases:\n",
    "1.  **Initialization & Preprocessing:** Standardizing the input text (lowercasing), performing initial splitting (words/punctuation), calculating frequencies, representing words as character sequences with crucial `</w>` end-of-word markers, and building the initial character-based vocabulary.\n",
    "2.  **Iterative Training:** Looping for a predefined number of merges (`num_merges`). In each iteration, we precisely counted adjacent symbol pair frequencies across the *current* corpus state (weighted by word frequency), identified the single most frequent pair, recorded this merge operation along with its priority (based on the iteration number), created a new subword symbol, updated the *entire* corpus representation by replacing the merged pair with the new symbol, and added the new symbol to the vocabulary.\n",
    "3.  **Inspection:** We examined the final vocabulary size, the list of learned merge rules sorted by the priority in which they were learned, and the final token representation of sample words from the training corpus.\n",
    "4.  **Tokenization of New Text:** We took an unseen text input, applied the *exact same* preprocessing steps, and then, for each word, iteratively applied the learned merge rules. Crucially, in each tokenization step for a word, we found the merge rule with the *highest priority* (earliest learned) that was applicable to the current sequence of symbols for that word, applied only that merge, and repeated the process until no more learned merges could be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting `tokenized_output` is a sequence of strings, where each string is either an original character or a learned subword from the final BPE vocabulary. This sequence represents the original input text, segmented according to the patterns learned from the training corpus. This detailed breakdown illustrates the core mechanics of BPE, forming the basis for more optimized and complex tokenizers used in modern NLP models."
